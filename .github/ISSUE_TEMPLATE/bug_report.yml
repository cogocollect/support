      1. Make sure that you first check if your bug hasn't already been reported. It saves a bit of work on our end.
      2. Please attach screenshots if they help in understanding the problem better. Don't host your images/videos/GIFs somewhere (e.g. Imgur) and share a link. Directly drag & drop here to avoid navigating to an external link.
      3. Make sure to format any code samples using triple backticks. If the code sample happens to be large, share a gist/pastebin link instead.
