## Before creating a new issue

*   **This tracker is for issues with Cogo Collect only.**

*   Search for the issue [here](https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/issues) to check if it was already reported.
    You may use [labels](https://github.com/sublimehq/sublime_text/labels) for filtering the issue list by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report or request.


## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.  
1.  Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
1.  Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include the following information:
    * Operating System
    * The version of Cogo Collect that you're using
    * Any related software which may cause CC to act strangely

    Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
1.  Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a code example for this. **if a specific code produces the bug, try to share the code**
1.  Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps but prepare to answer a few question if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs you can also read [these guidelines](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) for bugzilla bugs.


## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
1.  Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
1.  Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
